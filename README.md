A project to demonstrate preparing data for use by a Hidden Markov Model.

To get started download and review the HMM_Feature_Engineering PDF

Clone the repo to your local machine then ensure you have the required libraries installed or create a custom environment make for this project from the .yml file in the repo.

Activate the environment with the required libraries installed then open and run the HMM notebook file.

Look through the output in the notebook and in the figs/ and model/ directories

Any feedback is welcome, Thanks!

Hey!
Since you are working in a workbook I'm going to give my feedback here.
Great comments, just one thing I tend to do is list the arguments and the returns in the function doc strings.
I heard what Marcus was suggesting at the end of class and I think if you go down that route it will be a very high quality project.
I like what you have done so far and wish you luck!
