A project to prepare data for use by a Hidden Markov Model.

To get started download and review the Presentation PDF

Clone the repo to your local machine then ensure you have the required libraries installed or create a custom environment make for this project from the .yml file in the repo.

Activate the environment with the required libraries installed then open and run the HMM notebook file.

Look through the output in the notebook and in the figs/ and model/ directories

Any feedback is welcome, Thanks!
